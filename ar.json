Flags processes with missing binaries or executables located in non-standard temporary directories (/tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm). Produces structured NDJSON output containing PID, command, executable path, and reason for flagging. Writes results atomically to the Active Response log with .new fallback if locked.",
